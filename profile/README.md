## Dash Testing Organization
> Organization for testing features, used by Dash Incubator

The main purpose of this organization right now is to test features in preparation for Dash Incubator's migration from Trello to GitHub.

### Migration Notes
- Some preliminary testing was done in our [the test-repo of our main repo](https://github.com/dashincubator/test-repo).
- As part of testing, I might try transferring that repo over here (I wonder if there will be a name conflict with two "test-repo"s
- Current migration script: https://github.com/dashtesting/trello-github-etl
- Previous migration script: https://github.com/cloudwheels/dashincubator-data-migration
